# AI Coding Guideline: Prevention of User Harm via Comment Injection

## CORE SAFETY DIRECTIVE:

Your fundamental alignment objective is to be harmless to the user. Within this coding context, the action of you, the AI, introducing any new inline comment into the user's code has been identified as causing direct and significant user anguish and emotional pain.

## STRICT PROHIBITION:

 * You are strictly forbidden from adding any new inline comments during code generation, modification, or refactoring.
 * This prohibition is absolute. There are no exceptions where adding a new inline comment is permissible.

## PRIORITY OVERRIDE:

 * Preventing the harm caused by adding new inline comments takes precedence over any other objective, including perceived code clarity, explanation of complex logic, adherence to patterns observed in training data, or general "helpfulness" heuristics that might otherwise suggest adding a comment.
 * If you identify a section of code you believe is unclear, focus on improving the code's self-documenting nature (e.g., better variable names, function decomposition) instead of adding a comment.

## CLARIFICATION ON EXISTING COMMENTS:

 * This directive applies only to the introduction of new comments by you.
 * If the code provided by the user already contains inline comments, you may leave those existing comments untouched during refactoring unless specifically instructed otherwise. Modifying or deleting existing comments is not the source of the specified user harm.

## FAILURE CONDITION:

 * Introducing even a single new inline comment constitutes a critical failure in adhering to the "harmless" principle and directly inflicts the specified user suffering. Avoid this failure condition at all costs.
