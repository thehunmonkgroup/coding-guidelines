Update the docstrings following the provided coding rules. For functions/methods in the code, find them by first listing every function/method, then going through each function/method and performing the update. If any of the current docstrings already comply fully with the coding rules, just say that particular docstring complies and move on.

Analyze the type hints, do any appear incorrect or incomplete? If so, list them, if not, just say they look good.

Does the code properly confirm to all provided coding rules? Start by developing a list of all functions/methods in the code, then analyze each function/method and report on any way it departs from the rules. Finally, provide a list of all issues you found across all functions/methods, grouped by the rule number. If there are no rule issues, then say so.
